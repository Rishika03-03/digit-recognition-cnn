# MNIST Digit Recognizer

This is a simple deep learning project that recognizes handwritten digits (0 to 9) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Trains on the MNIST dataset (images of handwritten digits)
- Tests the model's accuracy on real digit images
- Predicts the digit from your own image (e.g., a photo of a digit you wrote)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Make sure Python is installed.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
3. Install required packages: pip install tensorflow pillow numpy
4. Place your handwritten digit image in the same folder and name it:
5. Run the script: python mnist_cnn.py

## ✅ Output Example

Epoch 5/5
accuracy: 0.9916 - loss: 0.0264
Test accuracy: 0.9904
Predicted digit from your image: 5

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pillow
- NumPy

## 📚 Credits

- Dataset: MNIST (via TensorFlow)
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Pillow, NumPy
